* GRIN Siphon

GRIN Siphon is a robust, highly configurable tool for academic
libraries that have partnered with Google Books and wish to work with
their contributions to Google's digital archive via Google's GRIN
interface.  Grin Siphon's design implements a loosely coupled,
Kanban-style workflow that coordinates asynchronous processes which
communicate with one another via tokens that are passed along a
pipeline, along wth tools to manage and orchestrate the workflow.

GRIN Siphon was developed to enable Princeton University Library to
ingest all of its Google Books into Figgy, PUL's own digital
repository, but its design makes it adaptable to a variety of projects
that require long-running workflows.

The =docs/= directory in this repository contains instructions for
installing, configuring, and running GRIN Siphon; a description of its
architecture; and suggestions for augmenting and customizing it.
